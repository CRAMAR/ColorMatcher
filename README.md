# ColorMatcher (Alpha)

ColorMatcher is an open-source desktop application to assist matching paint and gelcoat colors. It lets users enter a target color and a sample color, then visualizes both in a color space to guide tint adjustments.

## Status
- Alpha releases only (tag format: `alpha-*`)
- Manual color input for now (NIX Mini 3 integration planned)

## Development
- Cross-platform desktop app built with Avalonia UI
- Primary development target: Linux

## Running locally
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

## Releases
Alpha releases are created automatically when tags like `alpha-0.1.0` are pushed.
